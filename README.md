# Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. It serves as a platform for potential employers, clients, and collaborators to learn more about my work. The site includes multiple pages that cover my bio, project showcases, and a contact form.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a professional online presence that effectively communicates my competencies in web development and design. It is tailored for recruiters, clients, and other industry professionals looking for a comprehensive view of my work.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes to provide a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Accessible Content**: The website is designed to be accessible to all users, with high-contrast text, alt text for images, and semantic HTML structure.
- **Interactive Elements**: The site includes interactive components such as pop-ups, modals, and form submissions, all controlled by the user.
- **Custom CSS and Tailwind CSS**: Custom styles and Tailwind CSS enhance the user experience while adhering to modern web standards.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the site.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **JavaScript**: To handle interactivity and enhance user experience.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To ensure responsive design and consistent styling.

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Alt Text**: All images include alt text descriptions to aid screen readers.
- **Color Contrast**: Colors have been chosen to ensure sufficient contrast between text and background elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The site is fully navigable via keyboard for users who may not use a mouse.

## Testing

The website has been manually tested across various devices and browsers to ensure consistent performance and responsiveness. All code has been validated using the W3C HTML and CSS validators, with no significant issues found.
